# DecisionTree
This project is about learning from decision tree, using a simple pruning tecnhique

## Repository Overview:
The repository has 6 files:
- dataset.py: class to represent a given dataset
- decisiontree.py: class to represent the decision tree
- decisionleaf.py: class to define a leaf of the decision tree
- decisiontreelearner.py: this file include the function to create the decision tree and to use the pruning technique
- test.py: this file contains all the functions used to create the dataset from a file that contains dataset and to test the results  
- main.py: file to make tests and generate plot

## Dataset:
You can download the 3 datasets used from the following links:
